# 🚀 Uber Trip Analysis - Machine Learning Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to analyze **Uber trip data** to identify patterns and build a predictive model for trip demand. Using **advanced machine learning algorithms**, we predict Uber trip counts based on features such as **time of day, day of the week, month, and active vehicles**.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to find key trends in Uber trip demand.  
- Build **ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)** to predict trip counts.  
- Apply **feature engineering** to extract relevant time-based insights.  
- Compare models using **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** for accuracy evaluation.  
- Implement an **ensemble model** to enhance forecasting accuracy.  

## 📁 Dataset  
Dataset used: **Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv**  
- **Date/Time** - Timestamp of the ride.  
- **Active Vehicles** - Number of active Uber vehicles in service.  
- **Trips** - Total trips recorded for that timestamp.  
- **Dispatching Base Number** - Uber base associated with the trip.  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
✅ **Python** - Primary programming language  
✅ **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation  
✅ **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization  
✅ **XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting** - ML models  
✅ **Scikit-learn** - ML preprocessing & evaluation  
✅ **Joblib** - Model saving & loading  

## 🔄 Project Workflow  
### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**  
- Convert **Date/Time** column to proper datetime format.  
- Extract time-based features: **Hour, Day, Day of Week, Month**.  
- Handle missing values and ensure clean data for modeling.  

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Trips per Hour** – Identify peak demand hours.  
- **Trips per Day of Week** – Find weekly trends.  
- **Active Vehicles Impact** – See correlation between available vehicles and trips.  

### **3️⃣ Feature Engineering**  
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables (dispatching base numbers).  
- Selecting key features impacting trip predictions.  

### **4️⃣ Model Training**  
- **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting** trained on Uber trip data.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.  
- **TimeSeriesSplit** applied to ensure temporal consistency in model validation.  

### **5️⃣ Model Evaluation**  
**MAPE Scores for Accuracy Check:**  
✅ XGBoost → **8.37%**  
✅ Random Forest → **9.61%**  
✅ Gradient Boosting → **10.02%**  
✅ **Ensemble Model (Combination of all models)** → **8.60%**  

### **6️⃣ Model Saving & Deployment**  
- Models stored as `.pkl` files using `joblib`.  
- Can be reloaded for future predictions without retraining.  

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- **Trip demand is highest during specific peak hours and days.**  
- **Active vehicles strongly correlate with total trips.**  
- **Ensemble model provided the best forecasting accuracy.**  

## 💾 How to Use This Project  
### **Installation**  
First, install the necessary libraries:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost scikit-learn joblib
```

### **Run the Analysis**

```

### **Load Saved Models for Future Predictions**  
```python
import joblib  
model = joblib.load('xgb_model.pkl')  
new_predictions = model.predict(new_data)  
print(new_predictions)
```

## 🔥 Future Enhancements  
🚀 **Use deep learning models for more complex forecasting**
